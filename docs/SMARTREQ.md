## Amazon Alexa Developer Account

Create or have access to [Amazon Developer Services](https://developer.amazon.com/) account - sign-up is free - if you do not have account then create one

> **_NOTE:_** This account owns your Alexa skill for Smart Mirror. Make sure the account you are using is the same account you use in your Alexa device (Phone / Echo) and connect this with AWS CodeStar

## AWS Account

If you do not have existing AWS account please see instructions how to create one.

Please see [Create and activate AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/)

> **_NOTE:_** We use AWS region Ireland (eu-west-1) throughout examples - other regions should work as well.

## AWS costs from this project

This solution will add cost as per consumed services (Code*, SSM, Cloud9 (micro EC2 instance, S3, EBS))
- Used services are [AWS Free Tier eligible](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) `for a new AWS accounts`

Free tier covers:
* EC2 for Cloud9 (running only when IDE is active - by default it shuts down after 30 minutes)
* Persistent storage need (S3 Artifacts + EBS for Cloud9)
* Data Transfer out is free up to 100GB (more than sufficient to Smart Mirror)
* One active AWS CodePipeline

Additional costs:
Per on premise (Raspberry Pi) deployment there is cost of 2 cents per deployment/update for AWS CodeDeploy

Estimation of cost outside of Free Tier is less than 1$ per moth - depending mainly of amount of updates you make.

> **_NOTE:_** If you activate Advanced instance tier for SSM then that incurs `$0.00695` per advanced on-premises instance per hour (~5$ in month) - This is NOT required for Smart Mirror and should not be activated with SSM if you want to avoid the cost. See https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/pricing/ for additional details.
